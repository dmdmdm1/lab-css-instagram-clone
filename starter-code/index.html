          <p>
           Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with
           friends and family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and
            feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even
            share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the
           world.
          </p>
          <p>Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?</p>
